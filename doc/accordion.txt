INTRODUCTION                                                         *accordion*

Got too many vsplits? Accordion will squish all of them except the one
currently focused and a configurable number of its neighbors on each side.

Accordion can either be used to adjust the layout once or to continually
enforce the layout for the current tab or all tabs.

To adjust the layout one time, type 'Accordion 3' where 3 is the number of 
vsplits you want to be limited to seeing. To restore your layout to normal,
type 'AccordionClear'.

If you want accordion to continually enforce a layout, try 'AccordionStart 3' 
or 'AccordionStartTab 3' (only applies to one tab). Every time you split or 
switch windows, accordion will re-layout to enforce that you never have too 
many vsplits crowding your screen. To turn this off, use 'AccordionStop'.

==============================================================================
LIMITATIONS                                              *accordion-limitations*

1. |AccordionStop| only calls |AccordionClear| on the current tab even if
    there are other tabs that were locked
2. Accordions are not recalculated when moving up/down. Using horizontal 
    splits in general may cause slightly unexpected behaviors. Please open an 
    issue on github if you run into any of these.
