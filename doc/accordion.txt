INTRODUCTION                                                         *accordion*

Got too many vsplits? Accordion will squish all of them except the one
currently focused and a configurable number of its neighbors on each side.

Accordion can either be used to adjust the layout once or to continually
enforce the layout for the current tab or all tabs.

To adjust the layout one time, type :call Accordion(3) where 3 is the number
of vsplits you want to be limited to seeing. To restore your layout to normal,
type :call AccordionClear().

If you want accordion to continually enforce a layout, try :call
AccordionStart(3) or :call AccordionStartTab(3) (only applies to one tab).
Every time you split or switch windows, accordion will re-layout to enforce
that you never have too many vsplits crowding your screen. To turn this off,
call AccordionStop().

==============================================================================
LIMITATIONS                                             *accordion-limitations*

1. AccordionStart applies for all tabs but AccordionStop only resets the current tab
2. Perhaps some people would prefer if you moved the viewport by "pushing"
  against its borders rather than by always centering the sliding window
  on the focused window
